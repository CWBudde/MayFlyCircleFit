# MayFlyCircleFit Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** Use `${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/collaboration/executing-plans/SKILL.md` to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Build a high-performance circle-fitting optimization tool with CPU/GPU backends, web UI, and live progress visualization.

**Architecture:** Go-based CLI with Cobra, modular optimizer/renderer interfaces, HTTP server with SSE streaming, templ-based UI, and SIMD-accelerated evaluation kernels.

**Tech Stack:** Go 1.21+, Cobra (CLI), templ (frontend), slog (logging), net/http (server), optional chi (routing), cgo+SIMD (performance), OpenGL/OpenCL (GPU)

---

## Phase 1: Core Domain Model ✅ COMPLETE

**Implemented:**

- `Circle` struct: Position (X, Y, R) + Color (CR, CG, CB) + Opacity
- `ParamVector`: Flat float64 encoding of K circles (7 params per circle)
- `Bounds`: Parameter validation with configurable ranges
  - X, Y: [0, width/height]
  - R: [1, max(width, height)]
  - Color/Opacity: [0, 1]
- `MSECost`: Mean Squared Error cost function over RGB channels
- Helper functions: `EncodeCircle`, `DecodeCircle`, `ClampCircle`, `ClampVector`

**Test Coverage:** 6 passing tests (encoding, bounds, clamping, MSE)

---

## Phase 2: CPU Renderer ✅ COMPLETE

**Implemented:**

- `Renderer` interface: Render(), Cost(), Dim(), Bounds(), Reference()
- `CPURenderer` struct: Software rendering with Porter-Duff alpha compositing
- `renderCircle()`: Bounding-box optimized circle rasterization
- `compositePixel()`: Premultiplied alpha blending

**Test Coverage:** 2 passing tests (white canvas, single circle rendering)

---

## Phase 3: Optimizer (Mayfly - Using External Library) ✅ COMPLETE

**Implemented:**

- `Optimizer` interface: Run() method for optimization algorithms
- `MayflyAdapter` struct: Wrapper for external Mayfly library with configurable variants
- Variant support: Standard, DESMA, OLCE, and other Mayfly algorithm variants
- Constructor functions: `NewMayfly()`, `NewMayflyDESMA()`, `NewMayflyOLCE()`

**Test Coverage:** 2 passing tests (sphere function optimization, deterministic behavior)

---

## Phase 4: Pipelines (Joint, Sequential, Batch) ✅ COMPLETE

**Implemented:**

- `OptimizationResult` struct: Holds best parameters, costs, and iteration info
- `OptimizeJoint()`: Optimizes all circles simultaneously
- `OptimizeSequential()`: Adds circles one at a time greedily
- `OptimizeBatch()`: Adds batches of circles in multiple passes

**Test Coverage:** 3 passing tests (joint, sequential, batch optimization pipelines)

---

## Phase 5: CLI with Cobra (Log-only UX) ✅ COMPLETE

**Implemented:**

- `run` command: Single-shot optimization with configurable modes (joint/sequential/batch)
  - Flags: --ref, --out, --mode, --circles, --iters, --pop, --seed
  - Image loading, optimization, and output saving
  - Metrics reporting (cost improvement, circles/sec throughput)
- Stub commands: `serve`, `status`, `resume` (placeholders for future phases)
- Test image: assets/test.png for validation

**Commands:**

- `mayflycirclefit run --ref <image>` - Run optimization
- `mayflycirclefit serve` - Stub for Phase 6
- `mayflycirclefit status` - Stub for Phase 6
- `mayflycirclefit resume <job-id>` - Stub for Phase 7

---

## Phase 6: Background Server + Job Model + Live Progress ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** A long-running HTTP server that executes optimizations in the background with real-time progress via SSE.

**Implemented:**

- Job management with thread-safe state machine (pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled)
- Background worker for async optimization execution with context cancellation
- HTTP server with graceful shutdown and middleware (CORS, logging)
- REST API endpoints:
  - POST /api/v1/jobs - Create and start job
  - GET /api/v1/jobs - List all jobs
  - GET /api/v1/jobs/:id/status - Get job status with metrics
  - GET /api/v1/jobs/:id/best.png - Render current best image
  - GET /api/v1/jobs/:id/diff.png - False-color difference visualization
- CLI `serve` command with signal handling and graceful shutdown
- CLI `status` command for querying jobs (list or specific)
- Helper functions for image loading and diff computation
- Comprehensive test coverage for all components

**Note:** SSE (Task 6.5) was deferred as the polling-based status endpoint provides sufficient functionality for Phase 6 goals.

  - [ ] Output binaries to `dist/` directory
- [ ] Create release archives
  - [ ] `.tar.gz` for Unix systems
  - [ ] `.zip` for Windows
  - [ ] Include binary, README, LICENSE, example images
- [ ] Set up GitHub releases (or equivalent)
  - [ ] Automated release creation from tags
  - [ ] Upload build artifacts
  - [ ] Include changelog in release notes
- [ ] Document installation from release binaries

### Task 13.13: CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Set up continuous integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
  - [ ] Run tests on every commit
  - [ ] Run linters (golangci-lint)
  - [ ] Test on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - [ ] Test with and without cgo
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
  - [ ] Upload to codecov.io or similar
  - [ ] Add coverage badge to README

  - [ ] Run benchmarks on every commit
  - [ ] Track performance regressions

### Task 13.14: End-to-End Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Verify complete user journeys
  - [ ] New user: install → run first example → see results
  - [ ] Server mode: start server → create job via UI → view progress → download results
  - [ ] API mode: create job via curl → poll status → fetch images
  - [ ] Resume: start job → kill server → restart → resume
- [ ] Test on fresh installations
  - [ ] Clean VM or container
  - [ ] Follow README instructions exactly
  - [ ] Document any missing steps
- [ ] Test with real-world images
  - [ ] Various sizes and formats

## Summary and Next Steps

This plan covers **Phases 0-13** in complete detail with bite-sized, testable tasks. Each task follows TDD principles:
1. Write failing test
2. Run test to verify failure
3. Write minimal implementation
4. Run test to verify pass
5. Commit

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Follow phases sequentially for maximum stability
- Complete all tasks in a phase before moving to the next
- Use TodoWrite to track progress within each phase
- Update PLAN.md with completion status as you go
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Document learnings and decisions in CLAUDE.md

**Current Status:** Phases 1-8 complete. Phase 8 (Persistence & Checkpoints) fully tested and documented. Ready to begin Phase 9 (Performance Profiling).
